this is for lab7

part1 - make the described finite-state-machine based on logic expressions and nine flip flops with one hot encoding
part2 - using vhdl statements to create the state-machine we need instead
part3 - TBD
part4 - create a morse-code encoder based on inputs from switches and then blinking and LED
